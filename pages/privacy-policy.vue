              This Privacy Policy describes how CXBrainstorm collects, uses,
              shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also
              describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of
              your personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy and Cookie Policy applies only to information we
              collect, process and use through the CXBrainstorm Website. This
              Privacy and Cookie Policy does not apply to information that we
              collect through other channels, such as information that we
              collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us.

            <h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
            <h3>Personal Information that You Provide Us Actively</h3>
            <p>
              When you fill out registration forms or provide us with other
              personal information actively, you will know what personal
              information we are collecting, processing and/ or using because
              you are actively submitting it. Because we change our offerings
              and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us
              with personal information also may change, but here are some
              examples of situations in which you may decide to provide personal
              information to us:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating an account;</li>
              <li>Signing up for email alerts;</li>
              <li>
                Completing a form related to one of our products or services;
              </li>
              <li>Contacting us for technical support or customer service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Depending on how you interact with CXBrainstorm, the personal
              information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create
              an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In
              other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a
              particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other
              information, which may include your name, phone number.
            </p>

              Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site
              account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the

            <h3>Information We Collect by Automated Means</h3>
            <p>
              When you use the CXBrainstorm Website, your device is
              automatically providing information to us so we can respond and
              customise our response to you. The type of information we collect
              by automated means may vary, but generally includes technical
              information about your computer, such as your IP address or other
              device identifier, the type of device you use, and operating
              system version. The information we collect also may include usage
              information and statistics about your interaction with the
              CXBrainstorm Website. That information may include the URLs of our
              web pages that you visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages,
              page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type,
              location data (if you have enabled that collection on your mobile
              device), and other information about how you used the CXBrainstorm
              Website.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Automated means of data collection may include the following:
            </h3>
            <p>
              <b>Web Browser.</b> When you visit a CXBrainstorm website, your
              browser automatically sends us your Internet protocol ("IP")
              address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your
              computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional
              information, such as whether the computer or device has ever been
              used to visit the CXBrainstorm Website before, which CXBrainstorm
              features were used the most often, and how much time was spent on
              a page.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Web Beacons and Log Files.</b> We use "web beacons" (also known
              as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on
              our websites and those of certain of our job posting clients.
              These web beacons allow us and third parties to collect
              information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the
              web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used,
              and any additional information in cookies that may have been set
              by the third party. The information is typically collected in log
              files, which generally track traffic on our websites. We use this
              information for a variety of purposes, including the management of
              our online advertising by establishing which ads brought users to
              our websites. The information also is used for analytical purposes
              and to manage technical issues that may arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Cookies.</b> We also collect, process and/or use information
              using cookies or similar technologies to help us identify you when
              you visit the CXBrainstorm Website and we may share cookies with
              third-party advertisers or advertising networks to serve you
              relevant, targeted ads unless youâ€™ve opted out from such sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Mobile Device ID.</b> If you access or use the CXBrainstorm
              Website on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, including
              tablets, we collect mobile device identifiers and IP Address. We
              may create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar
              to an account number. We may collect the device type and any other
              information you choose to provide, such as user name, geolocation
              or email address.
            </p>
            <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
            <p>
              We do not currently respond to 'do not track' signals and similar
              settings or mechanisms. When you use the CXBrainstorm Website, we
              try to provide a customised experience.
            </p>

            <b>How We Use Information/Purposes</b>

            <p>
              We may use the information we collect: <br />
              to provide you with personalised content, services offered by
              CXBrainstorm as well as promotional content and services; <br />
              to moderate and display the company performance KPIs, reports and
              other content you have submitted for the benefit of our other
              users; <br />
              to customise and improve the features, performance, and support of
              the site; <br />
              to show you relevant information, if you connect to the
              CXBrainstorm Website through a Social Networking Site, from your
              Social Networking Site friends and connections, and to allow you
              to share job and profile information with them; <br />
              to provide relevant advertising, including interest-based
              advertising from us and third parties, which may mean that we
              share non-personally identifiable information, such as your job
              title, to third-party advertisers; <br />
              to provide recruiting services to employers; <br />
              for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis,
              testing, research, and service improvement; <br />
              to communicate with you regarding our services; <br />
              to analyse use of the CXBrainstorm Website and improve the
              CXBrainstorm Website;<br />
              to create aggregate and statistical data that does not identify
              you individually and that we can commercialise; <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              for other purposes that you separately authorise as you interact
              with CXBrainstorm.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you set up an individual user account on CXBrainstorm, we
              create a member profile (a "Profile") for you that will include
              personal information you provide. You may permit us to share
              information in your Profile with prospective employer, recruiters
              and others. Subject to visibility settings that you control,
              subscribers to services we may introduce will be able to view
              information in your Profile. Because your anonymity on
              CXBrainstorm is important, your Profile does not include or link
              to information about the performance values you submit to
              CXBrainstorm.
            </p>

            <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
            <p>
              We do not disclose your individual account or usage data to third
              parties, except as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>With your consent;</li>
              <li>
                We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over
                the world that help us deliver our service and run our business
                subject to strict confidentiality agreements. (for example, if
                you enter credit card information on the CXBrainstorm Website in
                connection with a purchase, in most cases that information is
                sent directly from your browser to the third-party service
                provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not
                store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted
                to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose
                of credit card processing on our behalf.
              </li>
              <li>
                We share aggregated usage statistics that cannot be used to
                identify you individually;
              </li>
              <li>
                We will disclose data if we believe in good faith such
                disclosure is necessary (1) to comply with relevant laws or to
                respond to subpoenas or warrants or legal process served on us;
                (2) to enforce our CXBrainstorm Terms of Use and Privacy Policy;
                (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to
                prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an
                investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (4) as
                we otherwise deem necessary to protect and defend the rights or
                property of us, the users of our services, or third parties. Our
                general procedure with respect to civil subpoenas or
                properly-served demands requesting user data is to require a
                court order, binding on CXBrainstorm before we release such
                information;
              </li>
              <li>
                In a reorganisation or sale of our company or assets, your data
                may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the
                commitments made in this Privacy and Cookie Policy and
                compliance with applicable law;
              </li>
              <li>
                If you apply for a particular job through the CXBrainstorm
                Website, we will disclose your personal information to the
                employer to whom you apply and any vendors they are working with
                to process your application;
              </li>
              <li>
                We may invite you to include your CV or other information in
                more generally available formats and then offer third-parties
                the right to view this information, subject to visibility
                settings you control;
              </li>
              <li>
                We may share certain information that does not identify you
                personally, but which is unique to your use of the CXBrainstorm
                Website, such as job titles that you have entered at the time of
                registration or on your profile. When we share such information,
                we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this
                information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or
                employers.
